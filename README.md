# 🧰 Linux CLI Software Installation – Legacy Game Project

This project documents a hands-on challenge in installing and running the legacy platformer game **"N"** on a **Chromebook** using only the **Linux command-line interface (CLI)**. The game was not natively supported on the device, requiring a manual setup process using Linux tools.

## 🧠 Project Objective

While not a traditional cybersecurity project, this challenge showcases comfort with the Linux command line — a core skill for system administrators, cybersecurity analysts, and anyone working in technical operations.
